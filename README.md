# steganography
Text-based steganography using Python.

Steganography is the practice of hiding one piece of information within another, such as hiding text within an image.

Here the message is encoded into an image by altering the least significant bit (LSB) of each pixel's color value. The changes are small enough that they are not easily noticeable by human eyes.

Python Imaging Library (PIL) must be installed for image manipulation:

`pip install pillow`

**To run this code locally:**


1. Fork this repository

2. `git clone <Repository URL>`

3. `cd <Repository Name>`

4. `python main.py`


**Change the *source_image_path*,
     *output_image_path*,
     *message_to_encode* according to your need.**
    
Feel free to suggest any kind of improvement.
